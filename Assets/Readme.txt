- General -
The main game is in "Level 1", all other scenes where used to build the different components.
Only self-constructed objects (Ball, Cube, Wall, Ramp, Floor) can be damaged.

For the Fortnite like builder I used the scripts Builder, Player, GridCreator (Which has to be placed in scene if needed) and Target.
Every Object which has the Target attached an is in "InteractionLayer" can be destroyed by Bomb and Gun.

The grid in Level 1 is not the best fitting option. If the grid is changed to smaller scales, also the Prefabs "Wall_World", "Ramp_World" and "Floor_World"
have to be changed to the better fitting scale.

- Keymap -
Mouse0 -> Fire/Throw object in hand/place placable object
Mouse1 -> Put object in hand
Mouse3 -> Arm/unarm gun
Q -> Throw bomb
E -> Place box
F -> Throw ball
R -> Show/change placeable object
